# Kinetic Rotating Sculpture

A LEGO Technic kinetic sculpture designed as a hands-on STEM activity for learning mechanical engineering principles.

This project demonstrates a complete mechanical system with several key features:
- A hands-on STEM activity for learning mechanical engineering.
- A custom-designed gearbox built entirely from LEGO Technic components.
- Creates smooth, counter-rotating motion from a single motor input.
- Includes two distinct blade designs inspired by the work of kinetic artist David C. Roy.

The core of this project is the mechanical system. It demonstrates how to engineer a custom gearbox using standard LEGO Technic parts to solve a specific mechanical challenge: creating a smooth, counter-rotating motion from a single motor. This provides a clear and satisfying demonstration of gearbox principles.

### Repository Contents

This repository contains only the design files for the rotating blades. To use these files, you will need:

*   Vector graphics software capable of opening `.svg` or `.eps` files (e.g., Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape).

_LEGO instructions coming soon_

### Compatibility

The included `.svg` and `.eps` files are standard vector formats and should be compatible with most vector editing software.
